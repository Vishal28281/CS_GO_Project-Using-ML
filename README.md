# CS_GO_Project-Using-ML
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the winner of a round in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) based on game snapshot data. It explores data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and classification models to determine which team (Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists) is more likely to win a round.
